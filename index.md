Hi, I'm Dhruv Shah, a passionate Web Development student at Humber College with a strong desire to become a professional Web Developer. I also hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Application and a Graduate Certificate in Business Analytics, which has equipped me with a well-rounded skill set, blending technical expertise and analytical thinking.

My goal is to master full-stack development and build innovative, scalable, responsive and accessible web applications that deliver exceptional user experiences. I'm always eager to learn and grow, and currently, I'm diving deeper into modern web technologies like React and Node.js.
